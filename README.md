# T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia RNA Seq Analysis 

This repository stores a RNA Seq Analysis between the normal people and the patients with T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). It aims to study how perhexilline (a drug to treat T-ALL) actually treats T-ALL. 

The report can be found [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/lingminhao/Leukemia-RNASeq/a6a41349d8603f6211733f67693c5bf15cbb2d10/T-cell-Acute-Lymphoblastic-Leukemia-RNA-Seq-Analysis-.html).
